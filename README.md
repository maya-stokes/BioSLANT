# Tadpole
MIT landscape evolution model

Tadpole is a simple landscape evolution model that runs in MATLAB. The current version will run in 64-bit Mac OS X or Windows. To get started, copy one of the scripts from the Tadpole/examples directory into Tadpole/ and run it from there.

BioSLANT is a spatially explicit neutral community model takes the output from Tadpole and simulates the dispersal, speciation, and extinction of organisms throughout the river networks.  

If you use Tadpole for work that results in a publication, please acknowledge Tadpole in the text and cite one or more of the following papers, as appropriate:
